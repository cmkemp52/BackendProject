            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Poor Dietary Foundations</strong>: Eating habits developed as a child, such as always cleaning your plate and eating microwaved convenience foods.</li>
                <li><strong>Misinformation and Attitude</strong>: There are too many conflicting sources of information about nutrition. It can get confusing and complicated.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Motivation</strong>: You know you're not eating healthy, but it doesn't cause any distress right now, so why bother?</li>
                <li><strong>Slow Change</strong>: The results of a healthy lifestyle are slow and steady. Sometimes you don't see the results as quickly as you'd like, then give up.</li>
