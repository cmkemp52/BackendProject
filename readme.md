This was created for DigitalCraft's full stack development project.

Allows users to track daily food intake and provides nutrition advice based on foods logged. Nutrition advice is based on a 2000 calorie diet. Food logging capabilities are made possible using the USDA's APIs. 

Back end is Express Nodejs with ES6 template rendering. Makes use of a Postgres database for users to log in. When a user creates an account, a new table is created for that user for their food logging. 

Styling makes heavy use of Bulma, with a few elements styled by hand with CSS such as the nutrition facts.
